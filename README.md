# HedgeDoc website

This repository contains the source for the [homepage](https://hedgedoc.github.io)

## Development

The only tool you need is [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

Please make sure, that you use hugo extended! The code won't compile with the default hugo. If you're not sure about the version, run `hugo version` and check the output for the `/extended` suffix after the version.

To start the dev server just run `hugo server`.
